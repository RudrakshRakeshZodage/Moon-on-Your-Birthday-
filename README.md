# Moon on Your Birthday 🌙

🔍 I built an interactive web app using Python & Streamlit that combines astronomy and data visualization to give users a celestial snapshot of their birthday 🌙


🧠 What it does:
📆 Pick any birthdate from 1900 to 2100
🌕 See the accurate moon phase for that night using NASA ephemeris data
💡 Discover how illuminated the moon was (in %)
🖼️ View a simulated image of the moon’s appearance
🧾 Know the name of the moon phase (e.g., 🌔 Waxing Gibbous)
🌌 Automatically fetches the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) for your selected date
📥 Download the moon image straight from the interface
🚦 Displays API rate limits in real-time for transparency


🧰 Tech Stack & APIs Used:

🐍 Python 3
🖥️ Streamlit (Frontend UI)
📊 Matplotlib (Custom Moon Visualization)
🌌 Skyfield (Astronomy SDK by JPL/NASA)
🔭 NASA APOD API (for astronomy image of the day)

💻 This project was a mix of astronomy, API integration, and creative UI/UX design — and it was a blast to build! 🚀
Would love to hear feedback or feature ideas from fellow devs and space nerds 🛸

🔗 Try it out soon (before the API rate limit resets 😉)
📬 DM me if you want help building your own API-powered Streamlit app!
